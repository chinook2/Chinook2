This document explain how to complete a development environment for building mobile apps with Cordova.
Path examples are designed for 64 bits environment, for 32 bits replace "Program Files (x86)" by "Program Files"

# Development environment (Client Mobile)

## Installation

First visit https://github.com/chinook2/Chinook2/blob/master/client/development.md

 - Java JDK : http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html
 - Node.js : https://nodejs.org/en/
 - Cordova : npm install -g cordova@5.4.0
   - you must specify cordova version like this : npm install -g cordova@5.4.0
   if npm command not found check if "C:\Program Files\nodejs" is present in PATH environment variable
   - uninstall command : npm uninstall -g cordova
 - Android SDK : https://developer.android.com/studio#command-tools
   - prefer to install the SDK here : C:\Program Files (x86)\AndroidSDK
 - ADB Driver (optional) : https://github.com/koush/UniversalAdbDriver

Verify SDK Platform (Platform-tools and Build-tools), run the following command :
````
>android
````

If it doesn't work check if the following path is present in the PATH environment variable : C:\Program Files (x86)\AndroidSDK\tools

You need to select an API version for the SDK.
We recommend to use API 19 (Android 4.4) to have better compatibility... (Not sure !!) and Android SDK Build-tools 21

If an error occured for the installation re-run the SDK Manager as administrator (right click, "Run as administrator")

*IMPORTANT* : Cordova 5.4.x need API 22 !
For API 19 use Cordova x.x.x


To add Cordova support modify your applications app.json builds block as follows :

````
"builds": {
    "classic": {
        "toolkit": "classic",
        "theme": "theme-triton"
    },
    "modern": {
        "toolkit": "classic",
        "theme": "theme-triton",
        "packager": "cordova",
        "cordova": {
            "config": {
               "platforms": "android",
               "id": "com.mydomain.AppDemo"
            }
        }
    }
}
````

 run the following command (optional will be executed on build process the first time) :
 
 ````
 >sencha cordova init com.mycompany.AppDemo AppDemo 
 ````

 
## Building

To run the build use this command in the root of the application

`````
>sencha app build [testing/production]
````

Two things will be built :
 - the PC version in [root]/build/production/[app_name]
 - the mobile version in [root]/cordova/platforms/android/build/outputs/android-debug.apk
 
By default build process use "production" value (and not "testing")

To run application transfer the APK to the device and launch it from file explorer

## Quick deployment

You can launch your application on your device without having to transfer the APK on it.

First check on your device if USB debugging is ON. See about : https://www.kingoapp.com/root-tutorials/how-to-enable-usb-debugging-mode-on-android.htm
Then check if the USB connection mode is Mass Storage. See about : http://www.device-recovery.com/how-to-connect-android-devices-to-pc-with-usb-mass-storage-mode#note3

To check if the device is properly connected run this command to try to see your device

`````
>adb devices
````

If it's fine run this command to launch the application on your device

`````
>sencha app run [testing/production]
````

## Debugging

For classic building or quick deployement, once the application is running on the device, open Chrome on the PC which is connected to the tablet and go to

chrome://inspect/#devices

You should see your device. Click on "inspect" to open developer tools.

## Options

To show a splash screen ...

````
>cordova\cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-splashscreen
````

config.xml : 

Files are in \ProjectName\cordova\src

````
<platform name="android">
		<icon src="res/icon-hdpi.png" density="ldpi"/>
		<icon src="res/icon-hdpi.png" density="mdpi"/>
		<icon src="res/icon-hdpi.png" density="hdpi"/>
		<icon src="res/icon-hdpi.png" density="xhdpi"/>
		
		<splash src="res/splash-land-xhdpi.png" density="land-xhdpi"/>
		<splash src="res/splash-land-hdpi.png" density="land-hdpi"/>
		<splash src="res/splash-land-hdpi.png" density="land-mdpi"/>
		<splash src="res/splash-land-hdpi.png" density="land-ldpi"/>
		
		<splash src="res/splash-port-xhdpi.png" density="port-xhdpi"/>		
		<splash src="res/splash-port-hdpi.png" density="port-hdpi"/>
		<splash src="res/splash-port-hdpi.png" density="port-mdpi"/>
		<splash src="res/splash-port-hdpi.png" density="port-ldpi"/>
</platform>
<preference name="SplashScreen" value="screen" />
<preference name="SplashScreenDelay" value="10000" />
````

In Application.js to hide the screen when app is ready : 

````
launch: function () {
		// Cordova splashscreen
		if(navigator.splashscreen) navigator.splashscreen.hide();
````
